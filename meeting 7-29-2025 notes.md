to do
 - fix the bug: entropy jump between stages with higher RPMs
 - fix the bug where the isentropic pressure multiplies to the static pressure instead of stagnation pressure

TODO:         
return the blading curves (obtain the values)
calculate the updated areas based on the sums of the streamlines
record ALL of the streamline-stages rather than throwing them away after each streamline
