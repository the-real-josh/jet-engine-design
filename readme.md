# overview
Here is the structure of the code:
 - there is a class representing the compressor
 - The compressor is made of stages, so there is a class representing the stage
 - the stage is made of rotor and stator, and there is a class representing the velocity triangle of a single row of blades.

TLDR: There will be a class inside a class inside a class.

The reason for this is readability.
